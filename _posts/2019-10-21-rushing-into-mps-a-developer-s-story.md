Hello, world!

So this is the first in what I hope will become a long and tiresome journey to building a DSL for Artificial Intelligence: A Functional Approach.
To be fair. I have no academic degree. All my knowledge comes from reading papers, MIT OpenCourseware, Youtube and tonnes and tonnes of searching for useful knowledge on the Interwebs. There is just so much rubbish information out there that the Interweb can be misleading. Google the 'Siraj Scandal' if you're unsure what I'm talking about.

But enough ranting. What is my plan?

| A functional Domain Specific Language built on the principles of Mathematics and Physics with a simple to use API for Artificial Intelligence.

Let's face it programming is difficult enough. To learn programming, mathematics, physics and computer science in complete depth would be a near impossible task. Their domains are extensive and far reaching. Because of the sheer complexity and how my brain works. I have to document everything I learn, because I will forget.

I think as humans we are afraid of forgetting. But I think my strongest talent is the ability to forget. To forget mistakes I've made and to learn the solutions. Sometimes we are so hung up on learning the mistakes that we forget the solution. I don't want to be like that. This applies to all areas of life.

I've just started to play the violin and in 3 days I've been amazed at how I learned to play "Happy Birthday". I forgot all the mistakes and only learned the solutions. I think this is an important concept to `Artificial Intelligence`. I think computers which remember everything will skew their data to become completely emotional. When weighed down by an overwhelming amount of emotion we tend to be negative. I'm very concerned about how this may transgress our fate as humans.

So now more on MPS.

So after downloading you should see something which looks like this:

One thing I absolutely love about this project is that they have a tonnes of resources to learn about this subject. That goes without saying that they many `sample` projects to learn from which is absolutely great.

| Kudos to the Jetbrains team. Really. Thanks to Everyone of you!!

So that is my first impression on MPS and my plans for the future.
