    <h4>Cameron de Bruyn</h4>
    <p class="light"><b>iOS Engineer</b></p>
    <p class="light">Cameron has been developing iOS Apps since 2018. Not a very long time. But in that time he has managed to grasp many of the core skills. Even delving into some of the particularly interseting topics. Cameron's career happened by chance when he was accepted into the WeThinkCode_ coding school in 2016. Since then he has worked day and night to perform to the best he can. Future plans include working on data teleportation.</p>
